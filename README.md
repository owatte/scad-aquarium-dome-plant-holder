Ball Aquatic Moss Plants Cultivation created with openscad (Dome Shape Aquarium Marimo Moss)

## Generate STL

The .scad file provides both dome and stopper parts. 

To generate 2 distincts STL files, you just have to set `true` or `false` on `DOME` and `STOPPER` constants (line 20, 21).

### dome STL
```
DOME = true;
STOPPER = false;
```

### stopper STL
```
DOME = false;
STOPPER = true;
```

## Download STL on thingiverse site
